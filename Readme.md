[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/simplecrawler-queue-mongo.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/simplecrawler-queue-mongo)

Mongo powered queue for [SimpleCrawler](https://github.com/cgiffard/node-simplecrawler/)

# Install

```shell
npm install simplecrawler-queue-mongo
```

# Use

```coffee-script
Crawler  = require "simplecrawler"
Queue    = require "./simplecrawler-queue-mongo"
mongoose = require "mongoose"

mongoose.connect "localhost/test"

crawler       = Crawler.crawl "http://radzimy.co/"
crawler.name  = 'radzimy-co' # You don't need this if you only run one crawler.
crawler.queue = new Queue mongoose.connections[0], crawler
```
which compiles to:

```javascript
var Crawler, Queue, crawler, mongoose;

Crawler   = require("simplecrawler");
Queue     = require("./simplecrawler-queue-mongo");
mongoose  = require("mongoose");

mongoose.connect("localhost/test");

crawler       = Crawler.crawl("http://radzimy.co/");
crawler.name  = 'radzimy-co';
crawler.queue = new Queue(
  mongoose.connections[0],
  crawler
);

```

# Notes

ATM it relies on Mongoose connection that application provide. In the future I'd like to decouple it, so that application could provide native MongoDB connection or connection string.

If you want to use multiple crawlers with one database (eg. for crawling multiple domains) set unique name property on each crawler (like in the example). It will be used to distinguish queues in a collection.
